# mod-mobile-app

This was a coding test that I worked on over a weekend for a company application.

Display customer information and include following functionality in the list: 
- A search bar that will filter the list based on the user input.
- Ability to sort the list by one of the fields.
- Ability to edit a list item and have the card update with the new information (only in local state not through the api)
​
You can use JS libraries such as lodash or underscore and a CSS ​or SCSS normalizer to make it easier to accomplish this task but we are most interested in your own code so please refrain from bringing in other libraries. Try to Include comments in the app letting us know your thought process.
